## Tired?
## Overwhelmed?
## Frustrated?
## Confused?

---

# What is the problem?

Why do I have the desire to distract myself?

### No clear task?
### No clear priorities?
### Overwhelmed by task or complexity?
### Task is finished &amp; pressure has eased?
### Annoying task (e.g. unfamiliar domain / just no fun)?

---

# Get a break!

A short break can help a lot, but not everything actually helps your brain relax.

### Get up &amp; walk some steps
### Do a tiny workout
### Get some fresh air (at least open the window)
### Medidate a bit or listen to music
### Put your thoughts on paper (or a wiki)

---

# No clear Task / Priority?

### -- Get an overview (in writing) --
* What are the overarching goals
* What are specifically my tasks?
* Who might need help?
* What is urgent and / or important?

### -- What would be a useful thing to do? --
* Current tasks
* Stuff from the backlog
* Learning something
* Anything else?

---

# Overwhelmed?

### -- Get an overview --
* What are the requirements?
* What are the priorities?
* What is unclear to me?
* What problems do I see?

### -- Write down available info and my analysis --

### -- Where can I get the missing information? --
* Ask for / discuss priorities and requirements
* Ask about the current state
* Create a PoC &amp; experiment
* Research and build up my knowledge

---

# No Motivation / annoying Task?

### -- Plan my approach --
### -- Talk to others --
* Are my problems known?
* Do maybe partial solutions / test setups etc already exist?
### -- Set up the required dev &amp; test environment --
### -- Research the required knowledge --
### -- Analyze the problem more closely --
* Read the docs
* Try to better understand the existing code
